Javascript ECMAScript 6 advantages

Came into picture in 2015

1. Block scoped
{}

2. Introduced arrow
=>

3. Promise oriented

4. Classes

5. Modules
import export


Let, var and const

let and const are es6 deliverables

var is older

var has functional scope 

let and const are of blocked scope

var a = 0
let b = 1
const c = 2



const func = () => {
  var  a = 1
  let  b = 2
  const c = 1
}
func()

//output a = 1 b = 1 c = 2
